       /* There is alot that can be done in this game. I'm not too 
       sure how much i can actually do. I do plan to have a 
       roulette picture so it will give the user something to 
       reference to. With the site map, I don't think I can expand
       it past one page, just alot of alerts and user inputs. So i will go into detail on how i plan on coding this. I will
       give a few pages i will attempt to make for the site map.
       */

       //User prompt, i will explain to the user how many chips they have to start

       //The console will ask for an amount the user wants to bet

       //After the bet, the user will have a options in which they 
       //can choose what to bet on. These are the options i plan on 
       //implementing, and possibly more.

       //I could try and each bet all their seperate pages, and just transfer a variable(user chips value) between them. The game will just start to take shape as i code it.
